# TemperCore
Launcher/Manager for all of my released programs
# Files
Place everything in the dedicated folder the program makes, for example DreamWriter, it will be C:\Program Files\DreamWriter, also be sure to keep the exact name or it will try to download it again
# Todo
1.) Compare bytes of files instead of filename so you can rename it whatever you want
